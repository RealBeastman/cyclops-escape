The simplest bit of code that I will upload to github.

This is a simple text-based game with no real goal or end.

As of today (6/30/2022) I am still deciding if this will be updated.
This is being uploaded to track and show off my own progression with python, as well as save a backup of any practice scripts
I develop while working with python.

Do not expect any updates outside of basic improvement to the code itself, but I may turn this into a much larger game when I run out
of practical ideas to practice with. Only time will tell.

Enjoy!
